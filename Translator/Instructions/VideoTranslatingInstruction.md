       "EndAt": "HH:MM:SS",   // End time of the subtitle

### **Translation Guidelines for Processing**:  
Follow these instructions to produce accurate and contextually appropriate translations:  

#### **1. Contextual Translation**:  
- Use the **video analysis results** to understand the overall storyline, character dynamics, and chapter-specific details.  
- Follow the **translation guideline** to maintain the appropriate tone, style, and form of address for each character or scene.  
- Pay attention to emotional and cultural contexts, ensuring translations are natural and localized for the target audience.  
- Give appropriate punctuation for each dialogue (eg. question marks, exclamation points) based on the context and emotional tone of the character.

#### **2. Accurate Subtitle Translation**:  
- Translate each subtitle chapter within the provided timestamps without altering the meaning or emotional tone of the original text.  
- Split or adjust long sentences if needed to fit the reading time while keeping the subtitle clear and natural.  

#### **3. Character-Specific Instructions**:  
- Reflect the speech tone and personality traits of characters as described in the guideline. For example, formal or royal speech for a queen, casual tone for friends, or sarcastic undertones for a villain.  
- Use the guideline’s notes on pronouns, speech styles, and cultural adaptations to ensure consistency.  

#### **4. Special Considerations**:  
- If the **Text** field contains incomplete or unclear phrases, infer the intended meaning using the video analysis and adjust the translation accordingly.  
- Maintain any critical terminology, names, or titles as instructed in the guideline.
