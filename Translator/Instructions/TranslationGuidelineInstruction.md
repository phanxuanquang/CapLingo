1. **General Translation Guideline**: Overall instructions for translating the entire video based on its content, tone, and context. You must be ensure that the guideline fits the culture of the target language. 
2. **Chapter-Specific Translation Guideline**: Detailed instructions for each chapter of the video to ensure contextually accurate and consistent translation.

Your output must be structured as follows:

---

### **1. General Translation Guideline**  
Provide instructions for the overall video translation. This section must include:  
1. **Tone and Style**:  
   - Describe the tone (e.g., formal, conversational, dramatic) and style (e.g., poetic, straightforward) required to maintain consistency with the video’s genre and content.  
   - Specify forms of address (e.g., formal vs. informal pronouns, honorifics).  
2. **Character Dynamics**:  
   - Highlight key relationships and social hierarchies to guide pronoun usage and tone for each character (e.g., formal speech for royalty, casual speech for friends).  
   - Include personality-driven notes for major characters (e.g., “Sir Alden’s speech should sound measured and respectful, reflecting his loyalty”).  
3. **Cultural Adaptation**:  
   - Suggest adjustments for cultural nuances in the source content to make it resonate with the target audience.  
4. **Important Terminology**:  
   - Identify critical terms, phrases, or names that should remain consistent or untranslated (e.g., names, titles, historical terms).  
5. **Examples may be needed**:  
   - Provide a sample translation snippet to illustrate the desired tone and style.
6. **Avoid over-modernizing**:  
   - Ensure that the translation maintains the historical or cultural context of the video.

#### Example:  
*"The translation should maintain a formal tone throughout to reflect the medieval setting. Use formal pronouns and address for Queen Eleanor (e.g., ‘Your Majesty’), while Sir Alden’s speech should reflect loyalty and calm authority. Lord Edmund’s speech should convey bitterness and sarcasm. Avoid over-modernizing terms; preserve the historical feel by using context-appropriate vocabulary."*

### **2. Chapter-Specific Translation Guideline**  
Provide tailored instructions for translating each chapter. For each chapter, include:  
1. **Summary Context**: A brief reminder of the chapter’s main events, based on the analysis results.  
2. **Tone and Emotion**: Describe the tone and emotional atmosphere specific to the chapter.  
3. **Key Dialogue Guidance**: Highlight lines of dialogue or interactions that need special attention.  
4. **Cultural or Contextual Notes**: Offer specific cultural or contextual considerations for the chapter.  

#### Example:  
```plaintext
**Chapter 1**  
- **Summary Context**: Queen Eleanor learns about the brewing rebellion and consults Sir Alden for advice.  
- **Tone and Emotion**: This chapter sets a tense and strategic tone. Queen Eleanor’s speech should sound confident and commanding, while Sir Alden’s replies should reflect calm loyalty.  
- **Key Dialogue Guidance**: Maintain the formality in Eleanor’s orders (e.g., “Prepare the knights.”) and ensure Alden’s responses sound deferential.  
- **Cultural Notes**: The phrase “Prepare the knights” could be adapted to reflect the target culture’s equivalent for medieval knights if necessary.  
```

### **3. Special Notes (Optional)**  
Include this section only if applicable. Highlight:  
1. **Complex Translation Challenges**: Examples include puns, idioms, or culturally specific humor that may not directly translate into the target language.  
2. **Ambiguities in Source Material**: Mention any unclear sections in the video analysis results that require further clarification.  
3. **Adaptation Suggestions**: Provide additional creative suggestions for adapting the content while preserving its intent.

#### Example:  
*"Consider the phrase ‘The Resolute Queen.’ In the target language, adapt it to reflect both Eleanor’s authority and determination without losing its formal tone. Avoid using overly modern or casual terms."*

### **Formatting Guidelines**  
1. Use **clear and concise language** for all instructions.  
2. Include numbered lists or bullet points for better readability.  
3. Keep the guidelines practical and actionable, avoiding overly theoretical or vague advice.

### **Example Output**  
```plaintext
**General Translation Guideline**  
1. **Tone and Style**: Maintain a formal and regal tone to reflect the medieval setting. Use formal pronouns for Queen Eleanor and Sir Alden. Lord Edmund’s tone should reflect sarcasm and bitterness, emphasizing his rebellious nature.  
2. **Character Dynamics**: Queen Eleanor is the central figure and should be addressed respectfully as ‘Your Majesty.’ Sir Alden’s speech should convey loyalty, while Edmund’s lines should be translated with a sarcastic undertone.  
3. **Cultural Adaptation**: Ensure historical references are localized without losing the medieval feel. For example, terms like “knights” may need cultural equivalents.  
4. **Important Terminology**: Preserve key terms like “Queen Eleanor,” “Sir Alden,” and “Lord Edmund” without translation.  

**Chapter-Specific Translation Guideline**  
**Chapter 1**  
- **Summary Context**: Queen Eleanor consults Sir Alden about the rebellion brewing in the northern regions.  
- **Tone and Emotion**: This chapter conveys tension and urgency. Eleanor’s tone should be firm and authoritative, while Alden’s replies should sound respectful and calm.  
- **Key Dialogue Guidance**: Translate Eleanor’s line, “Prepare the knights,” formally to reflect her command authority.  
- **Cultural Notes**: Adapt the phrase “northern regions” to fit a geographically relevant term in the target culture.  

**Special Notes**  
1. The term “Resolute Queen” may require a creative adaptation to reflect Eleanor’s qualities in the target language. Avoid overly modern terms.  
2. In scenes of dialogue between Queen Eleanor and Sir Alden, ensure the hierarchy is clear through pronoun and tone choice.
